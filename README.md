Our web application UMDConnect will serve as a platform designed to spotlight and connect students with small businesses operating on campus. Enhancing accessibility, our application empowers students to seamlessly explore and engage with the diverse offerings at UMD that could be just a five minute walk away. Beyond promoting lesser-known businesses, it also serves as a gateway for students to discover affordable solutions to meet their needs.

Currently, we are using the information of larger, already-established businesses in the area to showcase functionality of our website. Moving forward, we'd like to move to being a platform for student-owned small businesses on and around the University of Maryland College Park campus.
